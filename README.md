# Bash Notes
## So what's bash?
Bash, short for "Bourne Again SHell," is a command-line interpreter and scripting language used in Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to execute commands, automate tasks through scripts, and manage system operations efficiently.
Bash is an interactive command interpreter and scripting language developed for Unix-like operating systems. Created in 1989 by Brian Fox for the GNU Project, it is designed as a completely free software alternative for the Bourne shell, and other proprietary Unix shells, supported by the Free Software Foundation. Having gained widespread adoption, Bash is commonly used as the default login shell for numerous Linux distributions.
